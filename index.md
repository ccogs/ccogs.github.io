Previously, I worked as an engineering manager at Twitter.

I got my undergrad degree from Virginia Tech in the beautiful Blue Ridge mountains. I was involved in research about regular expressions and bus delays; you can read more about that on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5xipaBsAAAAJ&hl=en)
