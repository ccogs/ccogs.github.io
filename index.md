Hi! I'm a software engineer, currently at Google, working on [Offline maps](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/6291838).

Previously, I was at Virginia Tech, working on, among other things:
* Research on regular expressions, and how they're [rarely reusable or portable](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3338906.3338909) between languages and how [they represent a large DOS security threat](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3236024.3236027).
* Assessing [causes of bus delays](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0361198119832866) in the Washington, DC bus system (collab w/WMATA). 
* [TA-ing](https://courses.cs.vt.edu/cs2505/fall2017/) Computer Organization I (fundamentals of assembly/linux-type systems).
* The ACM competitive programming team, where I gave multiple lectures to 30+ people.
