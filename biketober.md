## What you need

* Bike
* Helmet
* White front light and red tail light ([required](https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/bicyclists/biketips.shtml#laws) by NYC)
* 2L of water and some snacks
* Sunscreen
* Rain jacket if appropriate

## Help! I don't have a bike!

Unfortunately, you do need one. Please do not use a CitiBike. I would suggest you use a road bike or a hybrid bike and not a mountain bike. 

I've been told you can rent a bike for $30/day, so you would need to spend $90 for Biketober. 

## Help! I'm afraid to ride a bike in traffic!

Biketober was made for you! We'll arrange an initial start point that is close to everyone's house to limit time spent biking alone. Most of the routes will be fairly car-free and you won't be expected to do anything too scary.

If desired, we can also do a special "City Biking 101" course on 19 September or 20 September. You can use a citibike for that.

## Help! I'm worried I'm unfit!

If you can walk ~5 miles with no problem/breaks, you can Biketober. However, I suggest focusing on slight uphill walking (12-3-30 at the gym on a treadmill) or stationary cycling throughout September to prepare.

## How do I sign up?
